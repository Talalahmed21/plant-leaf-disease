Peach Bacterial Spot Disease
Peach Bacterial Spot is a bacterial infection that affects peach trees. It causes dark, raised lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit, leading to defoliation, fruit loss, and reduced overall tree health.

Possible Causes
Bacterial Pathogen: The disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni.
Rain or Overhead Irrigation: The bacteria thrive in wet conditions, spreading through rain or irrigation splashes.
Wounds: Injuries to the plant, like pruning cuts, provide entry points for the bacteria.
Poor Air Circulation: Crowded or dense planting can limit air circulation, creating a humid environment suitable for disease development.

Actions Required
Prune Affected Parts: Remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent the spread of the bacteria.
Sanitation: Practice good sanitation by cleaning pruning tools to prevent bacterial transfer.
Avoid Overhead Watering: Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plant to reduce moisture on leaves.
Copper Sprays: Apply copper-based sprays as a preventive measure during the growing season.
Consult Experts: Seek advice from plant pathologists or local agricultural extension services for accurate diagnosis and management recommendations.
