Grape Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot) Disease
Grape Leaf Blight, caused by the Isariopsis fungus, is a disease that affects grapevines, leading to the development of circular, dark brown spots with a lighter center on the leaves. These spots may coalesce and cause the leaves to wither and drop prematurely, potentially reducing grape yield and quality.

Possible Causes
Humid Conditions: High humidity or wet weather creates an environment conducive to fungal growth.
Poor Air Circulation: Dense foliage or overcrowded plants can lead to increased humidity.
Infected Plant Material: Fungal spores can overwinter on infected leaves or debris, causing new infections.
Inadequate Pruning: Lack of proper pruning can result in dense foliage, favoring disease development.
Insect Damage: Insect feeding can create entry points for the fungus.

Actions Required
Prune Infected Leaves: Remove and dispose of affected leaves to reduce spore spread.
Improve Airflow: Prune grapevines for better air circulation within the canopy.
Fungicide Application: Consult experts for appropriate fungicides to manage the disease.
Clean Debris: Remove fallen leaves and plant debris to prevent overwintering of spores.
Consult Experts: Seek advice from horticulturists or plant pathologists for accurate diagnosis and guidance.
