Apple scab Disease
Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing dark, scaly lesions on leaves, fruit, and sometimes even young twigs. The disease is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis, and it can significantly reduce fruit quality and yield if not treated promptly.

Possible Causes
Moist and humid weather conditions create favorable environments for the growth and spread of the Apple Scab fungus.
Infection often occurs through splashing water, which spreads the fungal spores from infected leaves to healthy ones.
Infected plant debris left on the ground can serve as a source of overwintering spores, contributing to disease persistence in the following growing season.
Lack of proper orchard sanitation and removal of fallen leaves can lead to increased disease pressure.

Actions Required
Implement Fungicide Sprays: Use fungicides as a preventive measure following recommended schedules and guidelines to protect healthy plant parts from infection.
Prune Infected Plant Parts: Promptly remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit to reduce the source of inoculum and limit the disease's spread.
Monitor Weather Conditions: Be aware of weather conditions conducive to disease development, such as high humidity and frequent rain, and adjust spraying accordingly.
Maintain Good Orchard Sanitation: Remove and dispose of fallen leaves and fruit mummies to reduce overwintering of the fungus and minimize disease pressure in the next season.
Plant Disease-Resistant Varieties: Consider planting apple tree varieties that are resistant to Apple Scab to reduce the risk of infection.
Seek Expert Advice: Consult with a horticulturist or plant disease expert to confirm the diagnosis and develop an effective management plan.
Test the Prediction with an Expert: While our prediction is based on similarities, it is essential to validate the diagnosis through proper tests conducted by a plant disease specialist. Expert evaluation can provide accurate diagnosis and tailored solutions for effective disease control.
