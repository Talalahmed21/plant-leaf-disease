Tomato Leaf Mold Disease
Tomato Leaf mold is a plant disease caused by the fungus Fulvia fulva, also known as Cladosporium fulvum. It primarily affects the leaves of various plants, causing characteristic yellow patches on the upper surface of the leaves and grayish or brownish spores on the lower surface. This disease can lead to reduced photosynthesis and nutrient absorption, impacting the plant's overall health and productivity.

Possible Causes
High humidity and moist conditions encourage the growth and spread of the leaf mold fungus.
Overcrowding and lack of proper air circulation in plant canopies facilitate disease spread.
Poor plant hygiene, including the presence of infected plant debris and fallen leaves, can contribute to disease development.
Lack of disease-resistant plant varieties may make plants more susceptible to leaf mold.

Actions Required
Immediately remove and dispose of infected plant parts to prevent further spread.
Ensure adequate spacing and pruning to promote airflow between plants.
Maintain proper plant hygiene by regularly cleaning up fallen leaves and debris.
Plant disease-resistant varieties when possible to reduce susceptibility.
