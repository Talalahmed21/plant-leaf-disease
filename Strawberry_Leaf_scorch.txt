Strawberry Leaf Scorch Disease
Strawberry Leaf Scorch is a fungal disease that affects strawberry plants, causing the browning and necrosis of leaf margins and tips. As the disease progresses, the affected leaves develop a scorched appearance, with browning extending inward from the edges. This can weaken the plant, reduce its vigor, and impact fruit production.

Possible Causes
Fungal Pathogen: The disease is primarily caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earlianum, which infects the leaves and leads to scorch-like symptoms.
Humidity and Moisture: High humidity and wet conditions create an ideal environment for the fungus to thrive and infect the plants.
Poor Air Circulation: Crowded planting or lack of proper spacing can limit airflow between plants, contributing to higher humidity levels.
Contaminated Tools and Equipment: Using contaminated tools or equipment can spread the disease from one plant to another.
Infected Plant Material: Infected plant debris left in the garden can harbor the fungus and cause new infections.

Actions Required
Prune Affected Leaves: Remove and destroy severely affected leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.
Fungicidal Treatment: Apply fungicidal sprays recommended for controlling strawberry leaf scorch to prevent further infection.
Improve Air Circulation: Properly space out strawberry plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.
Water Management: Water the plants at the base to keep the foliage dry, as wet leaves create a favorable environment for the fungus.
Plant Resistance: Consider planting disease-resistant strawberry varieties that are less susceptible to leaf scorch.
Consult Plant Experts: Seek advice from plant disease experts or horticultural extension services to confirm the disease and receive guidance.
Expert Testing: While your app provides image-based predictions, it's crucial to verify the diagnosis through laboratory testing by a plant disease expert. Visual predictions are based on similarities, but laboratory tests offer accurate confirmation.
By taking proactive measures and adopting proper disease management practices, you can help control Strawberry Leaf Scorch and maintain the health and productivity of your strawberry plants.
