Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot (Gray Leaf Spot) Disease
Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot, commonly known as Gray Leaf Spot, is a fungal disease that affects corn plants. It manifests as small, circular grayish lesions with dark borders on the leaves, which can coalesce and cause significant damage. The disease weakens the plants' ability to photosynthesize, leading to reduced yield and overall plant health.

Possible Causes
Humid Conditions: High humidity and moisture on the leaves create an environment favorable for fungal growth.
Warm Temperatures: Warm temperatures between 75-85°F (24-29°C) encourage the disease's development.
Overhead Irrigation: Watering plants from above can splash fungal spores onto the leaves, promoting infection.
Plant Crowding: Dense planting increases humidity and reduces air circulation, aiding the spread of the disease.

Actions Required
Remove Infected Leaves: Prune and discard affected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.
Provide Adequate Spacing: Properly space plants to enhance air circulation and reduce humidity.
Fungicide Application: Apply fungicides as recommended by experts to manage the disease.
Crop Rotation: Avoid planting corn in the same location for consecutive seasons to break the disease cycle.
Consult an Expert: Reach out to a local agricultural extension office or a plant pathologist for accurate disease identification and advice.
