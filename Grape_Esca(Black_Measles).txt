Grape Esca (Black Measles) Disease
Grape Esca, commonly known as Black Measles, is a complex grapevine disease characterized by various symptoms, including wilting leaves, black streaks in the wood, and black spots on the leaves resembling measles. This disease affects the vascular system of grapevines and can lead to reduced vine vigor and grape quality.

Possible Causes
Fungal Complex: Esca is caused by a complex of fungi that work together, including Phaeoacremonium spp., Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, and Fomitiporia mediterranea.
Wound Entry: The disease often enters through pruning wounds or injuries.
Infected Wood: Wood infected with the fungi can carry the disease over from one growing season to the next.
Environmental Stress: Drought stress, heat, and other environmental factors can increase susceptibility to Esca.
Vector Transmission: Insects such as treehoppers and cicadas can transmit fungal spores, contributing to disease spread.

Actions Required
Prune and Destroy: Prune and remove infected wood promptly during dormant seasons.
Sanitize Tools: Disinfect pruning tools between cuts and between plants to prevent spreading the disease.
Fungicide Application: While challenging, some fungicides may help reduce fungal growth on pruning wounds.
Cultural Practices: Proper canopy management and vine health practices can reduce stress and susceptibility.
Expert Consultation: Seek guidance from plant pathologists and viticulture experts.
Expert Confirmation: Since prediction relies on visual similarities, consult experts for accurate diagnosis and validate predictions through lab tests.
Laboratory Testing: Send samples to a diagnostic lab for accurate identification of the fungal complex responsible for the disease.
