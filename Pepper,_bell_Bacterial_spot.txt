Pepper Bell Bacterial Spot Disease
Pepper Bell Bacterial Spot is a bacterial infection that affects pepper plants, particularly their leaves and fruits. The disease causes the appearance of small, raised, dark lesions on the leaves, which can later spread to the fruits. As the disease progresses, the lesions can merge, leading to leaf defoliation and reduced fruit quality.

Possible Causes
Bacterial Infection: The disease is primarily caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas euvesicatoria, which can be introduced through contaminated seeds, tools, or irrigation water.
Warm and Humid Conditions: Bacterial Spot thrives in warm and humid environments, making it more prevalent during periods of high humidity or rainy weather.
Poor Plant Hygiene: Lack of proper sanitation practices, such as cleaning tools and removing infected plant debris, can contribute to the spread of the disease.
Overhead Watering: Watering plants from above can create a favorable environment for the bacteria to spread from plant to plant.

Actions Required
Isolation and Removal: Immediately isolate infected plants to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy ones. Remove and destroy severely infected plants to avoid further contamination.
Copper-Based Sprays: Apply copper-based sprays, which are effective in managing bacterial diseases. These sprays can help reduce the spread of the bacteria.
Good Hygiene Practices: Practice good hygiene by disinfecting tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the disease.
Avoid Overhead Watering: Water the plants at the base to minimize water splashing and reduce humidity around the foliage.
Seek Expert Advice: Consult with agricultural extension services or plant disease experts for accurate identification and guidance on managing the disease.
Testing and Confirmation: While your app uses image-based predictions, it's advisable to seek confirmation from a plant disease expert through proper tests. The prediction is based on visual similarities, but a laboratory test can provide a more accurate diagnosis
