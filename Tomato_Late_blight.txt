Tomato Late Blight Disease
Tomato Late Blight is a fungal disease that affects tomato plants, causing dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. It's characterized by a rapid spread of the disease during periods of high humidity and cool temperatures. Late Blight can devastate tomato crops if not managed promptly, as it can lead to complete plant defoliation and fruit rot.

Possible Causes
Favorable Weather Conditions: Cool and wet weather conditions, especially during high humidity, create an ideal environment for the growth and spread of the Late Blight fungus.
Airborne Spores: The disease is spread through airborne spores that can travel over long distances, contributing to its rapid spread.
Infected Plant Material: Using infected plant material, including seedlings or transplants, can introduce the disease to your garden.
Poor Air Circulation: Crowded planting, which limits air circulation, can create conditions that promote the development and spread of the fungus.
Planting Density: Planting tomatoes too closely together can lead to increased humidity and limited sunlight, creating an environment conducive to disease development.

Actions Required
Early Detection: Regularly inspect tomato plants for symptoms such as water-soaked lesions, discoloration, and wilting.
Remove Infected Leaves: Immediately remove and destroy infected leaves and stems to prevent further spread.
Fungicide Treatment: Apply fungicides as a preventive measure or if symptoms are detected. Consult with an expert to choose appropriate fungicides.
Prune for Air Circulation: Properly space and prune tomato plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.
Avoid Overhead Watering: Water plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage, which can promote disease development.
Clean Garden Debris: Regularly clean up fallen leaves and other garden debris to reduce the presence of disease sources.
Expert Consultation: Seek advice from plant disease experts to confirm the presence of Late Blight and receive guidance on effective control measures.
Lab Testing: While your app provides image-based predictions, it's essential to confirm the disease through laboratory testing by a plant disease expert. Image predictions are based on similarities, while lab tests offer accurate confirmation.
By taking proactive measures to prevent and manage Tomato Late Blight, along with seeking advice from experts and conducting proper lab tests, you can minimize the impact of the disease on your tomato plants and ensure a healthier crop yield
