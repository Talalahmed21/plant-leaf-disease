Apple Black Rot Disease
Apple Black Rot is a destructive plant disease caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It primarily affects apple trees, causing dark, circular lesions on the fruit and leaves. As the disease progresses, the lesions expand, leading to premature fruit drop and significant damage to the apple crop.

Possible Causes
Warm and humid weather conditions create favorable environments for the growth and spread of the Black Rot fungus.
Infection often occurs through wounds or injuries on the fruit or leaves, making proper pruning and handling essential to prevent disease entry points.
Infected plant debris left on the ground can serve as a source of inoculum, contributing to disease spread.
Lack of proper orchard sanitation and hygiene practices can lead to increased disease pressure.

Actions Required
Promptly remove and destroy infected plant material to reduce disease spread.
Practice regular pruning to improve air circulation within the tree canopy and minimize potential infection points.
Use fungicides as a preventive measure following recommended schedules and guidelines.
Maintain good orchard sanitation by removing fallen leaves, fruit mummies, and pruned material to reduce the overwintering of the fungus.
Plant disease-resistant apple varieties when possible to decrease susceptibility.
Consult with a horticulturist or plant disease expert to confirm the diagnosis and develop a targeted management plan.
