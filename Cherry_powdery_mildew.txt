Cherry Powdery Mildew Disease
Cherry Powdery Mildew is a fungal infection that affects cherry trees, appearing as a white, powdery substance on the leaves, stems, and sometimes even fruit. This disease hampers the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis, weakening its overall health and potentially reducing fruit yield.

Possible Causes
Humid Conditions: High humidity and poor air circulation can create an environment conducive to fungal growth.
Moderate Temperatures: Moderate temperatures around 60-80°F (15-27°C) provide optimal conditions for the disease to thrive.
Plant Crowding: Overcrowded plantings can limit air movement and increase humidity, promoting the spread of the disease.
Infected Plant Material: Introduction of infected plants or using infected tools can contribute to the disease's spread.

Actions Required
Prune Affected Areas: Trim and dispose of infected leaves and stems to prevent the disease from spreading further.
Improve Air Circulation: Proper spacing between plants and regular pruning can improve air movement and reduce humidity.
Fungicides: Apply appropriate fungicides as recommended by experts to help control the disease.
Water Management: Water the plants in the morning to allow sufficient time for foliage to dry during the day.
Expert Opinion: Consult with a local horticulturist or plant pathologist for accurate disease identification and tailored guidance.

While your plant disease detection app is a valuable tool, it's important to remember that its predictions are based on visual similarities. For accurate results and effective treatment, consider seeking advice from experts and testing the prediction through proper laboratory tests.
